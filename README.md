# Lung Cancer Prediction Using CNN on Histopathological Images

**Project Overview:**

This repository focuses on leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict lung cancer from histopathological images. By analyzing detailed cellular structures, the CNN identifies patterns indicative of cancerous and non-cancerous lung tissue.

**Objectives:**

Develop a CNN model for accurate classification of lung tissue as cancerous or non-cancerous.

Ensure high reliability to support medical professionals in diagnosing lung cancer.

Explore diverse CNN architectures and techniques to optimize model performance.

**Dataset:**

The dataset comprises histopathological images categorized into:

**Cancerous:** Images indicating lung cancer presence.

**Non-Cancerous:** Images showing healthy lung tissue.

**Model Architecture:**

Utilizes a CNN consisting of:

**Input Layer:** Receives histopathological images.

**Convolutional Layers:** Extracts image features via filters.

**Pooling Layers:** Reduces feature map dimensions.

**Fully Connected Layers:** Classifies based on extracted features.

**Output Layer:** Predicts cancerous or non-cancerous classification.


**Implementation:**

Implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, the project includes:

**Data Preprocessing:** Normalization and augmentation for enhanced model generalization.

**Model Training:** Training CNN on preprocessed dataset.

**Model Evaluation:** Assessing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Model Deployment:** User-friendly interface for medical professionals to upload and analyze images.
